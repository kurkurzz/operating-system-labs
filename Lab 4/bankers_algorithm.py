# Banker's Algorithm
'''
Write a program to simulate the Bankerâ€™s algorithm for the purpose of
deadlock avoidance. Your program receives as input the number of 
processes in the systems and how many devices each job requires to complete 
execution. Your program shows how devices are allocated to each process as it 
executes and if the system is currently in a safe or unsafe state.
